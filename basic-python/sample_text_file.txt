In this article, the author attempts to convince readers that a predictive approach to inference is more meaningful than the usual inference based on parametric models. Predictive inference focuses on predicting future events/observations not yet observed based on values already observed. On the other hand, the author claims that the statistical inference based only on parameters is misleading since these parameters are unknown, hypothetical, and mostly for modeling convenience. Unlike the predictive approach, the usual parametric inference emphasizes on the unobservable, which cannot be verified eventually through realization. 
On the other hand, the usual parameter-based inference heavily emphasizes estimating unknown, unobservable, and hypothetical parameters.


The author highlights that moving towards the predictive paradigm will improve scientific rigor and reproducibility, and allow for easy comparison of different models. The third section of the paper, which discusses predictive methods for simple problems, was very well written. Reading the examples in this section helped me follow the author's arguments in the previous sections. However, adding a summary discussing the drawbacks of predictive inference could have provided a more holistic view of the paradigm. In addition to the author's encouragement to use predictive methods while working with parametric models, it would have been beneficial to comment on the predictive paradigm in non-parametric settings.
